AWARE — Malware Detection Prototype
AWARE is a simple, open-source prototype that demonstrates core ideas behind malware detection:

Hash-based detection (SHA-256) via a local signatures.json
Optional YARA scanning if yara-python is installed and rules are in rules/
Optional real-time monitoring using watchdog
Quarantine for detected files
JSON reports + a simple log
⚠️ This is an educational prototype, not production-grade security software.

Quick start
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or: py -3 -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows PowerShell

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Example: scan your Downloads folder (no YARA required)
python aware/aware.py scan ~/Downloads --quarantine

# Example: monitor a folder in real-time
python aware/aware.py monitor ~/Downloads --quarantine

# Add a custom malicious hash
python aware/aware.py add-hash path/to/suspect.bin --label MySample --severity high
Signatures
signatures.json ships with the EICAR test file's SHA-256 so you can validate detections safely. You can append your own hashes with add-hash. The format is intentionally simple.

YARA (optional)
If you install yara-python and place .yar rules in rules/, AWARE will compile and use them automatically. An example rule rules/example_eicar.yar is included.

Quarantine
When --quarantine is used, detected files are moved into quarantine/YYYYMMDD/ and set read-only.

Reports
Each scan creates a timestamped JSON report in reports/ with a summary and per-file results.
